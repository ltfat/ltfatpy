LTFAT 2.0 was released on October 10, 2014, more than three years after LTFAT 1.0

The Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a Matlab/Octave toolbox for
working with time-frequency analysis, wavelets and signal processing. It is 
intended both as an educational and a computational tool. The toolbox provides
a large number of linear transforms including Gabor and wavelet transforms 
along with routines for constructing windows (filter prototypes) and routines
for manipulating coefficients. 

The toolbox can be used for both educational, research and
computational purposes. It has a backend implemented in C, which can
be compiled to speed up all computational intensive functions.

The toolbox can be downloaded from http://ltfat.sourceforge.net.
For GNU Octave, it can also be installed from the Octave-Forge by running
pkg install ltfat -forge
but please first check the system requirements at http://octave.sourceforge.net/ltfat/index.html 
Users of Debian "jessie" may search for octave-ltfat package in their repository.

The main additions since 1.0:

Frames:
* Unified object-oriented framework for working with various types of frames in C^L.
* Uses fast algorithms instead of creating explicit matrices.
* Iterative algorithms where calculation of a dual frame is not feasible.
* LASSO and basis pursuit algorithms for sparse regularization.
* Reconstruction from magnitude of coefficients.

Operators:
* Object oriented framework for working with operators.
* Frame multipliers.
* Spreading operators.

Wavelets:
* Generalizations of MRA wavelet transforms.
* Library of basic wavelet filters.
* Discrete Wavelet Transform.
* General Wavelet Filterbank trees and wavelet packets.
* Undecimated versions of transform.
* Dual-tree Complex wavelet transform.
* Identical overall filterbanks.
* Effective calculation of frame bounds of all transforms.
* Canonical dual frames of undecimated transforms.

Filterbanks:
* Constant Q transform.
* ERBlet transform.

Gabor analysis:
* Gabor systems with non-separable lattices.
* Optimized dual and tight windows (requires UnlocBox, http://unlocbox.sourceforge.net).

Fourier analysis:
* Fractional Fourier transforms.
* Generalized Goertzel algorithm.
* Chirped Z tranform.

Block processing:
* Real-time audio capture and playback trough Playrec http://www.playrec.co.uk/ and
  Portaudio http://www.portaudio.com/.
* Blockwise analysis and synthesis using the frames framework.
* Programmable GUI panel for changing parameters during playback.
* Running spectrogram visualization.
* On-the-fly resampling for unsupported sampling rates.

And in general:
* More code moved to the backend C library.
* Compiles on Windows, Mac OS.
