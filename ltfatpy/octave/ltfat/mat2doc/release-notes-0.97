Release notes of LTFAT version 0.97

	New additions to the toolbox

	* The 'mulaclab' is a graphical user interface for
          manipulating the spectrogram of a signal. The gui works only
          in Matlab.

	* All function in the LTFAT C library are now available in
          both single and double precision

	* Compilation and interfaces for both Matlab and Octave
          interfaces now works on Windows XP.

 	* It is now possible to supply a window described by a text
          string or a cell array to all relevant functions. See the
          help on gabwin or wilwin for a description of the
          possibilities.

	* Much better support for optional argument in functions, and
          for setting default at startup. See the function
          ltfatsetdefaults, ltfatgetdefaults and ltfatarghelper

        * gabrieszbounds: compute Gabor Riesz bounds for a Gabor Riesz
            sequence.

	* wil2rect and rect2wil: arrange Wilson coefficients in a
          rectangular shape (with holes) at the correct position in
          the TF-plane.

        * peven and podd extracts the even and odd part of a signal.	  

	Changes since version 0.96

	* More functions now have an implementation in C: fftreal, dgtreal

	* fftreal was broken in 0.96. It now works and has a C
          implementation linking to FFTW.

	* Sign changes in all the spread* functions and in tconv to
          make them fit better with the sign convention of dgt.

	* bug fix in gabgrouplasso: it now uses Landweber iteration
          instead of the previous algorithm, which only worked for
          bases.
