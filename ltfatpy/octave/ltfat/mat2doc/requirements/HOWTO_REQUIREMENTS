This file explains howto install the necessary software to process the
requirements and how to do it

Install RMTOO
-------------

1) Download rmtoo from their homepage, and unpack the files.

2) Move the bin/ directory from rmtoo-23 and into
ltfat/mat2doc/requirements so that it becomes
ltfat/mat2doc/requirements/bin

3) Recursively copy the rmtoo subdirectory of rmtoo-23 into
ltfat/mat2doc/requirements so that it becomes
ltfat/mat2doc/requirements/rmtoo . Note that there is already a rmtoo
directory with files in it.

4) If you have overwritten the existing file(s) in rmtoo, change into
the directory and use "git checkout --" on the overwritten files to
restore them (yes, I should have made a patch, but this was easier)

Know you should have succesfully installed rmtoo

Running RMTOO
-------------

Change to ltfat/mat2doc/requirements . This is the basic directory to work in.

1) Run the command "source setenv.sh param"

From now you can use "make" to generate the files or "make clean" to clean up.

The output can be found in ltfat/mat2doc/requirements/artifacts . Look for the
generated .png files and requirements.pdf

Editing the requirements
------------------------

The files containing the requirements can be found in
ltfat/mat2doc/requirements/requirements .

If you add a new topic, you must also add a file in
ltfat/mat2doc/requirements/topics and edit TopLevel.tic in this
directory.

Deleting a requirement
----------------------

The Makefile gets confused if you remove or rename a
requirement. Manually delete
ltfat/mat2doc/requirements/artifacts/.rmtoo_dependencies and do a
"make"
