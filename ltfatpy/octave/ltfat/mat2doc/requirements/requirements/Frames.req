Name: Frame analysis
Type: requirement
Description: \textsl{LTFAT} \textbf{must} include a frame analysis framework
Rationale: An object-oriented framework implementing frames will make
 it easy for the user to try out different frames in an application,
 and it will make it easier for LTFAT developers to formulate
 high-level algorithms that work for all (or just some) frames.
