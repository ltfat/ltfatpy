% PINKNOISE Generates a pink noise signal
%   Usage: outsig = pinknoise(siglen,nsigs);
%
%   Input parameters:
%       siglen    : Length of the noise (samples)
%       nsigs     : Number of signals (default is 1)
%
%   Output parameters:
%       outsig    : siglen xnsigs signal vector
%
%   PINKNOISE(siglen,nsigs) generates nsigs channels containing pink noise
%   (1/f spectrum) with the length of siglen. The signals are arranged as
%   columns in the output.
%
%   PINKNOISE is just a wrapper around noise(...,'pink');
